		<h2>About TravelCard</h2>

		<p>TravelCard is the market leader in Switzerland for discounted hotel offers. Nowhere else can clients find such a wide selection of hotel discounts and special offers on a permanent basis. And unlike other providers, HotelCard takes zero provision or fee from hotels and therefore supports hundreds of small and family owned hotel businesses to improve their occupancy. Unique and simple, a win-win not just for the local hoteliers, but for our clients.</p>

		<p>Our team of travel and hotel specialists serves the interests of our members and partner hotels alike. We work tirelessly to provide our members with the best possible hotels and rates in Switzerland as well as neighbouring countries and to bring more guests to our partner hotels all year round.</p>

        <h2>The idea behind TravelCard</h2>

        <p>The TravelCard idea was born in 2009, quite literally at the kitchen table, when young Swiss entrepreneur Ivan Schmid was thinking of ways to improve the occupancy rate of his father-in-law’s hotel in the Engadin valley. The result was the “half-fare travel pass for hotels”, based on the idea of the popular half-fare pass for public transport. Quickly many hotels signed up as partner hotels and the number of members increased rapidly over the coming years.</p>

        <p>10 years after its launch HotelCard received a new management at the end of 2019 / early 2020 with TWINT founder Thierry Kneissler appointed as new Chairman. Investments were made in improving the technology platform and the business model was consistently adapted to the changing needs of hotels and members. The effort paid off, as HotelCard is now more popular than ever with members and hotels and is also enjoying increasing popularity in nearby countries.</p>
